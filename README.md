Docs Challenge
=================

Instructions
---------

* Challenge time: rest of the day (or the weekend if necessary)
* Feel free clarify project details with your teammates, but work on your own.
* Take care to ensure you have formatted it clearly.

Task
-------

As no doubt you may have found already, good documentation can be the difference between a software project surviving or perishing. It doesn't matter how good your code is - if people don't have clear instructions on how to get the most out of your program, you're risking losing your audience.

If that wasn't important enough, it's also vital to realise that potential employers will be reviewing your Github accounts, and if you have not taken the time to create clear and informative readme files, you're potentially losing a job.

So your task this week is to create FANTASTIC documentation explaining your Makerthon projects. Please use this as an opportunity to get more comfortable with Markdown (Github's Atom editor is a fantastic free tool for composing Markdown files) and find a way of structuring your readme files that you can create a format/template to apply to all of your projects going forward.

Makers Academy have seen some wonderful readme files from Alumni, and examples of great documentation is only a Google search away so there's certainly plenty of inspiration.

Your challenges will be marked on:

* Clarity of information
* Spelling and Grammar
* Formatting, and logical hierarchy of information
* Links to relevant resources
* Credits and attributions to teamates/others
* Installation and running instructions

Think of the best documentation you've seen. Most developers like code examples, much like pictures say a 1,000 words, code examples to developers will explain more in a few lines than paragraphs of docs. Write the documentation for Developers (and remember to use code snippets!)

If you find that you finish this challenge early and are sure there is nothing else you could do to your documentation, why not apply what you've learned to your existing repos? Have a fantastic weekend!
